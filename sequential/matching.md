## Matching, Guards and Scope of Variables

In the previous section we wrote a little example program for converting temperatures. In creating programs like that with special data structures (in our case, a list of cities and their temperatures), it's often useful to create utility functions which make working with our data more convenient.

In this case, it could be useful to find the maximum and minimum temperature in our data. We can add support for this by creating the necessary code little bit at a time. Let's start with creating functions for finding the maximum value of the elements of a property list:
